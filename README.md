# Learning Rest API with [Telusko(Navin Reddy)](https://courses.telusko.com/)

In this project I use jersey archetype.

For json and xml I use library json-media-moxy. So, this is implementation of content negotiation.

By the convention:
* **POST** is for creating resource
* **GET** is for fetching resource
* **PUT** is for updating resource
* **DELETE** is for deleting resource

For database I use MySql.
